# Tic-Tic-Toe-Game
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic 2-player turn-based game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with either an "X" or an "O." The goal is to get three of the same symbol in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to do so wins the game. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
